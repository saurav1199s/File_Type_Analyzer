  <p>Alice likes playing letter cubes. She has constructed a word from them and some of the cubes remain unused. Now, she chooses a new cube from the unused ones and adds it to the beginning of the current word. The question that wonders her a lot:&nbsp;how many new subwords does the cube add to the current word? Your task here is to write a program that helps Alice answer her question.</p> 
  <p><strong>Input</strong>: the first line contains a string $s$. The second line contains an integer $k$. The third line contains $k$ symbols separated by spaces.</p> 
  <p><strong>Output</strong>: for each symbol $c$ from the input, print the number of distinct substrings in a string $cs$ that are&nbsp;not presented in a string $s$. All numbers should be separated by spaces.</p>
