  <p>The basic version of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm allows finding all occurrences of one string in another. Along with this version, there exist&nbsp;some modifications&nbsp;that can be used to&nbsp;solve&nbsp;more sophisticated problems. One of them allows finding a string&nbsp;in another string represented as a matrix. In this task, you need to implement this modification of the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm.</p> 
  <p><strong>Input</strong>: the first line contains a pattern $p$. The second line contains two integer numbers $n$ and $m$. The rest of the lines represent a matrix $t$: $n$ rows&nbsp;each containing $m$ characters.</p> 
  <p><strong>Output</strong>: the first line should contain one integer $k$: the number of times the patter $p$ occurs in the&nbsp;matrix $t$. Each of the next $k$ lines should contain a pair of indexes&nbsp;where $p$ occurs in $t$. The first element of each pair should correspond to a row, the second one should be a column.&nbsp;The pairs&nbsp;should be sorted in ascending order (see the example below for details).</p> 
  <p>Assume, for example, that we want to find a pattern $p$ = "baac" in the below matrix:</p> 
  <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/4ab7ca2c-343f-473b-9542-2a2035bbb45f/"></p> 
  <p>As you can see, the pattern appears in the matrix twice: the first time at the index (0, 1), the second one at (2, 3). Note that although the second occurrence is split&nbsp;into two rows, it is still considered as an occurrence. Hence, the output should be:</p> 
  <pre><code class="java">2
0 1
2 3</code></pre> 
  <p>Keep in mind that all occurrences should be sorted by their row index first, and then by column index in case the firsts match.&nbsp;</p>
